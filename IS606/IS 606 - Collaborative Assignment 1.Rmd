I was playing around with the data to get a feel for it and figured this way you guys could see
what I was doing.  So far I haven't seen any patterns aside from frequent days where demand
for turkey and veggie sandwiches were greater than supply. I figure the next step might be to 
focus on how many days was demand greater than supply divided by total days for each type of 
sandwich and sum up total lost profit for each sandwich.

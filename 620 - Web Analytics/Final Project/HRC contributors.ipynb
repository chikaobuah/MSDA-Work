The profile of the politicans is interesting, as it only includes congressmen, not presidential candidates. All but four of the nodes in the graph are Republican Senators with a variety of powerful committee assignments. Two of the nodes - Kevin McCarthy and Patrick Tiberi - similarly hold powerful positions in the House. (McCarthy is the current Majority Leader and Tiberi a senior member of the Ways and Means committee.) The two Democrats in the graph - Chuck Schumer and Patty Murray - have both chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Murray has also chaired the Senate's Budget Committee. This small network shows us that the most connected politicans are those that serve or have served as leaders of various commmittees with powerful financial roles in politics and campaign cycles. Republican Sen. Rob Portman seems to be the most connected in the network."
